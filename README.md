# CloudEngine

CloudEngine is a C++/Opengl second year student project realised as a team of 3 peoples : [William Dewaele](https://github.com/Wdewaele), [Saad Raouf](https://github.com/Synyproxy) and myself, in the given time of 5 months.

## What is this project about
- Make a game engine from scratch in C++
- The final objective is to make a fps-puzle game with CloudEngine
- Use as few libraries as possible (if we want to use something, we have to implemente it)
- The project counts as our end year project for our second year at Isart Digital Montr√©al

 ## Libraries used
- Bullet
- Assimp
- Irrklang
- OpenGl
- Qt

## My part
Despite helping my partners, i made the math library ([CloudMath](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/CloudMath)), the Entity Component System ([ECS](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/Core/include/Core/ECS)), the Physic Engine using Bullet 3 ([Physic](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/Physic)) and the components and system needed to the physic to work ([Components](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/Core/include/Core/CoreComponent/Physic), [System](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/Core/include/Core/CoreSystem/PhysicSystem.h)). I also took care of the resources management ([Resources Management](https://github.com/CJeauc/CloudEngine/tree/master/CloudEngine/Core/include/Core/Managers)).
